# CarPi
This is the official repository for the CarPi project. 

## What is CarPi?
CarPi is a personal project designed to create a custom board computer using a Raspberry Pi with 
a touchscreen display.

If you want more detailed information (and able to understand German) than you can read more 
about this project on my blog: 
[rgunti.info/c/projects/carpi](https://rgunti.info/c/projects/carpi)

An English version will be created once the projects has reached a certain state of stability.
A first runnable version of this project is scheduled for Christmas 2017 although no promises 
are made.

## Can I contribute?
At the moment, no. Once the project has reached said level of stability and completion I will 
write some documentation to elaborate on the project. 

For the time being I will write status reports and small tutorials on my blog (German). 
I will eventually translate them to English as I write the projects documentation but for the 
time being this is not high on my priority list.

If you want to help translating everything, contact me via email (raphael@rgunti.ch) or on 
Twitter (http://twitter.com/rgunti).

Pull Requests will however not be accepted except for "useful" once. This could include problems
I was unable to solve or solutions that are more elegant, functional or robust than mine.
